This is a basic implementation of the [Battlesnake API](https://docs.battlesnake.com/snake-api). It's a great starting point for anyone wanting to program their first Battlesnake using Java. It comes ready to use with [Replit.com](https://replit.com) and provides instructions below for getting started. It can also be deployed to [Heroku](https://heroku.com), or any other cloud provider you'd like.
